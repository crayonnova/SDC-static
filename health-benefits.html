              <p class="card-title mx-1 py-3">1. Standing Lowers Your Risk of Weight Gain and Obesity</p>
              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                Weight gain is ultimately caused by taking in more calories than you burn.
                <br>
                Conversely, burning more calories than you take in results in weight loss.
                <br>
                While exercise is the most effective way to burn calories quickly, simply choosing to stand instead of
                sitting can also be beneficial.
                <br>
                In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has
                been shown to burn over 170 additional calories (6Trusted Source).
                <br>
                That’s almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing at your desk each afternoon.

              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                Generally speaking, the more your blood sugar levels increase after meals, the worse it is for your
                health.
                <br>
                This is especially true for those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.
                <br>
                In a small study of 10 office workers, standing for 180 minutes after lunch reduced the blood sugar
                spike by 43% compared to sitting for the same amount of time (6Trusted Source).
                <br>
                Both groups took the same amount of steps, indicating that the smaller spike was due to standing rather
                than additional physical movements around the office.

              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                The idea that standing is better for heart health was first proposed in 1953.
                <br>
                A study found that bus conductors who stood all day had half the risk of heart disease-related deaths as
                their colleagues in the driver’s seats (8Trusted Source).
                <br>
                Since then, scientists have developed a much greater understanding of the effects of sitting on heart
                health, with prolonged sedentary time thought to increase the risk of heart disease by up to 147%

              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                Back pain is one of the most common complaints of office workers who sit all day.
                <br>
                To determine if standing desks could improve this, several studies have been done on employees with
                long-term back pain.
                <br>
                Participants have reported up to a 32% improvement in lower back pain after several weeks of using
                standing desks

              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                Standing desks appear to have a positive influence on overall well-being.
                <br>
                In one 7-week study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who
                remained seated the entire work day (13Trusted Source).
                <br>
                Additionally, 87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day.

              <p class="card-sub mx-1">
                A common concern about standing desks is that they hinder daily tasks, such as typing.
                <br>
                While standing each afternoon may take some getting used to, standing desks appear to have no
                significant impact on typical work tasks.
                <br>
                In a study of 60 young office employees, using a standing desk for 4 hours each day had no impact on
                characters typed per minute or typing errors
